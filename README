ROMBoard : The Poor Man's Synthesizer
=====================================

Rom board is a piece of hardware I wrote for the Spring 2013 HackNY hackathon.

It demostrates the use of the WM8731 audio codec on Altera's DE2 development board.

This circuit causes the switches on the board to map a certain set of notes
to the four pushbuttons on the DE2. In this case, the note mappings have
been optimized to play Herbie Hancock's "Chameleon". Remapping the keys for
another song requires changing the ROM used by the hardware.
